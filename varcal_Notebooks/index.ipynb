    "## Introduction\n",
    "Variant calling is the process of identifying differences between the reference genome and the samples that have been sequenced. These differences can be single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), multi-nucleotide polymorphisms (MNPs) or small insertions and deletions (indels) and examples of each of these are shown below."
