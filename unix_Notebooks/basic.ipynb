    "_Directories_ are the Unix equivalent of folders on a PC or Mac. They are organised in a hierarchy, so directories can have sub-directories and so on. Directories are very useful for organising your work and keeping your account tidy - for example, if you have more than one project, you can organise the files for each project into different directories to keep them separate. You can think of directories as rooms in a house. You can only be in one room (directory) at a time. When you are in a room you can see everything in that room easily. To see things in other rooms, you have to go to the appropriate door and crane your head around. Unix works in a similar manner, moving from directory to directory to access files. The location or directory that you are in is referred to as the current working directory.\n",
